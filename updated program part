When you now create the home page to display the lecturer and program coordinator buttons When you first click on the lecturer button on home-page,
it is going to redirect you to a page called the Input Process which has the following information: first name, last name, staff number, Hourly rates, Hours worked and module department
which you will type in the module that you are trying to claim your income for those given hours worked, and by clicking the enter button a message should appear stating that “the information entered has been uploaded successfully”
as at this point we are not as of yet calculating and displaying the amount due to the lecturer for that specific module. When you press the cancel button,
it will clear all the information inserted in the given boxes and start the process all over again.
